# 💻 React JS Projects – Learning from Chai aur Code

This repository contains my hands-on **React.js practice projects**, following the YouTube series by **Chai aur Code (Hitesh Choudhary)**.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Doing

- Learning ReactJS from scratch
- Applying each concept through mini-projects
- Organizing each project in a separate folder for clarity
- Staying consistent with practice

### 🌟 Inspired by: Chai aur Code | #ReactJSJourney
Would you like a per-project README template too (for folders like currency converter and pass-gen)? I can generate that as well.








You said:
actually your not doing it correctly pleae combine code in one markdown file


ChatGPT said:
Thanks for clarifying, AR! You want everything (project list, learning info, and folder structure with actual src code tree) in one README.md file.

Here's the complete combined README.md that reflects your current setup accurately:
