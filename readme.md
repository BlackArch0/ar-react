# 💻 React JS Projects – Learning from Chai aur Code

This repository contains my hands-on **React.js practice projects**, following the YouTube series by **Chai aur Code (Hitesh Choudhary)**.

## 🧠 What I’m Doing

- Learning ReactJS from scratch
- Applying each concept through mini-projects
- Organizing each project in a separate folder for clarity
- Staying consistent with practice
